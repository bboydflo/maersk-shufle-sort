# Maersk Shuffle/Sort Assignment

This is my own solution to Maersk Shuffle/Sort Assignment. It can definitely be made simpler but I wanted to create a solution that never updates the DOM. This solution relies on CSS grid and the order of items in the grid.

This project has been bootstrapped with [vite](https://vitejs.dev)
